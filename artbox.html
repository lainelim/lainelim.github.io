                <h4><strong>Design Challenge</strong></h4>
                <p>ARTBOX held its first Singapore flea market in Apr 2017. Our jewellery brand, <a href="https://instagram.com/lovegemco">Lovegem Co</a> and lifestyle brand Jou Mourie jointly participated in the event.</p>
                <p>An attractive and functional booth layout was required to attract and manage visitors, raise brand awareness and ultimately, achieve sales over the 3 days.</p>

                <h4><u>Mockup of booth layout</u></h4>
                <p>Prior to the event, visits to similar flea markets were made in order to observe how flea market booths were designed to stand out, and to attract crowds to take a closer look at the products.</p>
                <p>Mock ups of the booth were made to visualize the operations and layout for the event.</p>

                <h4><u>Artbox: Day One</u></h4>
                <p>We encountered several issues on the booth layout, leading to a $50 sale for the whole day:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers' mental model of jewellery did not match the booth's display -- while earrings came in a pair, the booth displayed them singly for ease of trying</li>
                    <li>Lighting was too dim to attract the crowds who usually come after dark</li>
                    <li>Design of certain trendy items were too new; customers could not relate and visualize the pieces on themselves</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/works/firstday.jpg" class="section-img" alt="booth display">
                <p>We iterated by changing the display for earrings to match customers' mental model, added a floodlight for better visibility at night, and added a digital catalogue with modelling pictures to illustrate wear of certain trend pieces.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
                <h4><u>Day 2</u></h4>
                <p>We saw the following results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large increase in the number of visitors to the booth</li>
                    <li>10-fold increase in revenue</li>
                    <li>Sale of earrings made up 30% of total revenue for the day</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The same display on the third day yielded similar results as the second, with a slight increase in total revenue due to an earlier crowd on Sunday.</p>
